# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

This project focuses on a command-line application that can manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need to use the [MySQL2 package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries, the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) to interact with the user via the command line, and the [console.table package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console.
